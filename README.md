# Random Card Dealer in Javascript, HTML and CSS

In this project you will learn how to change your website styles during the runtime using VanillaJS (plain normal js).

## Instructions

Create an algorithm that randomly builds a card on every refresh:

1. Every time the website refreshes a new random card needs to show.

2. The card must have one of the possible suits: Hearts, Spades, Clubs and Diamonds.

3. The card value must be one of the following: 1 to 10, King, Queen, Jack or Ace, (no joker).

In the end, the project needs to look similar to this demo.

## Hints
* Remember that the first event of a website lifecycle is onLoad (your code starts running there). You should generate a random number between 1 and 4 to pick a suit and another random number between 0 and 12 to pick a card number.

* Create a general .card class that applies the general styles to each card, and one additional CSS class for each suit: .spade, .club, .heart & .diamond.

* Apply the .card class to the entire div but only apply one of the suit classes at a time, depending on what suit you want to apply. For example, a 3 of Hearts will have this

* You can use images, https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery or HTML character entities to generate the suit symbol into the HTML. Here you can find the character entities.
